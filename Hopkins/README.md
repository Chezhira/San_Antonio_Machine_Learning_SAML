# Using Stroke Data for Machine Learning Predictions

*Note: The descriptions and explanations required in each segment's deliverables will be updated throughout the course of the project.*

## Topic

The goal of this project is to use patient data to train machine learning models.  
**We hope to answer:**
1. How successfully can our model be used to predict stroke risk? 
2. Can it successfully predict if someone is a smoker?

## Data Source
The [source data](https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset) includes 5110 observations with 11 attributes. These attributes include physical and social aspects of the patient such as age, average glucose level, BMI, marital status, and if the patient lives in a rural or urban area.


The dataset was submitted to Kaggle by user [fedesoriano](https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano). It is listed as a confidential datasource, but appears to be a cleaned subset of the Electronic Health Record (EHR) controlled by McKinsey & Company; originally used as part of their [healthcare hackathon](https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/mckinsey-analytics-online-hackathon).
