# Using Stroke Data for Machine Learning Predictions

*Note: The descriptions and explanations required in each segment's deliverables will be updated throughout the course of the project.*

## Topic


The goal of this project is to use patient data to train machine learning models.  
**We hope to answer:**
1. How successfully can our model be used to predict stroke risk? 
2. Which aspect is more accurate to predict risk: medical or personal data?
<br></br>

This topic is dear to many of our team members. Some of us were personally affected by loved ones having a stroke or actively work in the healthcare industry. Additionally, strokes are on the rise in younger people, and are therefore affecting a larger portion of the population.  
We are passionate about improving diagnosis options to prevent strokes. Having predictability may encourage preventative care or medication to reduce stroke risk. 



## Data Source
The [source data](https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset) includes 5110 observations with 11 attributes. These attributes include medical and person aspects of the patient such as age, average glucose level, BMI, marital status, and if the patient lives in a rural or urban area.


The dataset was submitted to Kaggle by user [fedesoriano](https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano). It is listed as a confidential datasource, but appears to be a cleaned subset of the Electronic Health Record (EHR) controlled by McKinsey & Company; originally used as part of their [healthcare hackathon](https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/mckinsey-analytics-online-hackathon).
